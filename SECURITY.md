# Security & Sanitization

This document outlines how sensitive information has been removed from this repository to protect privacy while maintaining functional configuration structure.

## ✅ **Sanitized Information**

All sensitive information has been carefully removed and replaced with helpful placeholders:

### **Personal Identifiers**
- ❌ Real usernames → `username`, `your-username`
- ❌ Server hostnames → `media-server`, `download-server`
- ❌ Domain names → `your-domain.com`
- ❌ Location references → `REMOTE`, `LOCAL`

### **Network Information**
- ❌ Real IP addresses → `YOUR_SERVER_IP`, `YOUR_LOCAL_IP`
- ❌ Internal network IPs → Generic placeholders
- ❌ Specific hostnames → Generic hostnames

### **Authentication Data**
- ❌ API keys → `YOUR_[SERVICE]_API_KEY_HERE`
- ❌ Password hashes → `YOUR_PASSWORD_HASH_HERE`
- ❌ Newsgroup credentials → `YOUR_NEWSGROUP_USERNAME/PASSWORD`
- ❌ SSH key paths → Generic paths
- ❌ Encrypted passphrases → Placeholder text

### **Service-Specific Sanitization**

#### **qBittorrent Configuration**
- ✅ WebUI password hash replaced with placeholder
- ✅ File paths generalized to `/home/username/`
- ✅ External program paths made generic
- ✅ Interface binding addresses removed

#### **rclone Configuration**
- ✅ SSH key file paths generalized
- ✅ Host addresses replaced with placeholders
- ✅ Encrypted key passphrase replaced
- ✅ Remote name changed from specific to `MEDIA_SERVER`

#### **Sonarr/Radarr/Prowlarr Configuration**
- ✅ API keys replaced with descriptive placeholders
- ✅ All functional settings preserved
- ✅ Port and service configurations intact

#### **NZBGet Configuration**
- ✅ Newsgroup server credentials sanitized
- ✅ Server hostnames replaced with examples
- ✅ Control passwords replaced with placeholders
- ✅ All performance settings preserved

#### **SSH Configuration**
- ✅ Optimization settings preserved
- ✅ No sensitive authentication data included
- ✅ Performance tuning parameters intact

#### **Cloudflare Tunnel**
- ✅ Domain names replaced with generic examples
- ✅ Internal IP addresses sanitized
- ✅ Tunnel tokens removed
- ✅ Configuration structure preserved

### **Scripts Sanitization**
- ✅ Remote names changed to generic `MEDIA_SERVER`
- ✅ Location references removed (Singapore/Melbourne)
- ✅ File paths generalized
- ✅ All functional logic preserved

## 🎯 **What's Preserved**

While all sensitive data has been removed, the functional configuration structure is completely intact:

- ✅ **Exact port configurations**
- ✅ **Service interconnection settings**
- ✅ **Performance optimization parameters**
- ✅ **Automation trigger configurations**
- ✅ **Directory structure and paths**
- ✅ **Network optimization settings**
- ✅ **Queue management logic**
- ✅ **Error handling and retry mechanisms**

## 🔍 **How to Use These Configurations**

Each sanitized placeholder is clearly marked and self-explanatory:

1. **API Keys**: Generate new ones in each service's web interface
2. **Passwords**: Set your own secure passwords
3. **IP Addresses**: Replace with your actual server IPs
4. **Domain Names**: Use your own domain or subdomain
5. **File Paths**: Adjust to match your directory structure
6. **Server Names**: Configure with your actual server hostnames

## 🛡️ **Verification**

This repository has been thoroughly scanned to ensure:
- ❌ No real IP addresses
- ❌ No actual API keys or tokens
- ❌ No password hashes
- ❌ No personal domain names
- ❌ No server hostnames
- ❌ No newsgroup provider credentials
- ❌ No SSH keys or certificates

## 📋 **Before Deployment Checklist**

Before using these configurations in production:

1. **Replace all placeholders** with your actual values
2. **Generate new API keys** for all services
3. **Set strong passwords** for all web interfaces
4. **Configure SSH key authentication**
5. **Update IP addresses** to match your network
6. **Test all connections** between services
7. **Verify firewall rules** are correctly configured

This ensures you get a fully functional system while maintaining complete security of your personal infrastructure.
